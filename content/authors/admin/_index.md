I’m a Software Development Engineer at Amazon Web Services, focusing on building an agentic platform that leverages large language models to automate AWS cloud support workflows, analyze incidents, and drive near real-time remediation across large-scale distributed systems. Previously, I led observability and telemetry platforms for robotics at Dexterity, and worked on Spark on Kubernetes at Cloudera.

I specialize in distributed systems, real-time streaming and anomaly detection, and modern platform engineering. With published research in IEEE, ACM, and Springer, I’m passionate about taking systems from prototype to production and building platforms that improve reliability, scalability, and developer experience.

Focus areas: GenAI & multi-agent systems · Backend & Platform Engineering · Distributed Systems & Cloud Architecture · Kubernetes · Real-Time Telemetry
